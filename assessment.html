    <h2>HAPPY TEXT</h2>
      <p><strong>Trees</strong> grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Just beat the devil out of it. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff.</p>

      <p><strong>You</strong> don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. This is the fun part. This painting comes right out of your heart. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let your imagination be your guide. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.</p>
